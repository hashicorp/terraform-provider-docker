Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.8 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_NAME`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_NAME
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_NAME
$ make build
```

Using the provider

## Fill in for each provider

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.8+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_NAME
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `sh scripts/runAccTests.sh`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create a local registry which will be deleted afterwards.

```sh
$ sh scripts/runAccTests.sh
```

In order to extend the provider and test it with `terraform`, build the provider as mentioned above with
```sh
$ make build
```

Remove an explicit version of the provider you develop, because `terraform` will fetch
the locally built one in `$GOPATH/bin`
```hcl
provider "$PROVIDER_NAME" {
  # version = "~> 0.1.2"
  ...
}
```


Don't forget to run `terraform init` each time you rebuild the provider. Check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMmovxyo5sY&t=30m14s) for a more detailed explanation.

You can check the latest released version of a provider at https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-$PROVIDER_NAME/.
